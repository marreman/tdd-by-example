# Test-Driven Development by Example

Examples from the book in TypeScript, tested with Jest.

## Plan

- $5 + 10 CHF = $10 if rate is 2:1
- ~~$5 \* 2 = $10~~
- ~~Make `amount` private~~
- ~~Dollar side effects?~~
- Money rounding?
- ~~`equals()`~~
- `hashCode()`
- equal null
- equal object
- ~~5 CHF \* 2 = 10 CHF~~
- Dollar/Franc duplication
- ~~Common equals~~
- Common times
- Compare Francs with Dollars
